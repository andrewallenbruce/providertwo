Data for a state are considered unusable based on DQ Atlas thresholds for the following topics: Total Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment, Claims Volume - IP, Claims Volume - OT, Claims Volume - IP, Diagnosis Code - IP, Diagnosis Code - OT, Procedure Codes - OT Professional, Gender, Age, Zip code, Race and ethnicity, Eligibility group code, Enrollment in CMC Plans. \r\n\r\nData from Maryland, Tennessee, and Utah are omitted for the tables due to data quality concerns. Maryland was excluded in 2017 due to unusable diagnosis codes in the IP file and the OT file. Tennessee was excluded due to unusable diagnosis codes in the IP file in 2017 - 2019. Utah was excluded due to unusable procedure codes on OT professional claims in 2017 - 2020. In addition, states with a high data quality concern on one or more measures are noted in the table in the \u0022Data Quality\u0022 column.

Georgia reported data for individuals who continue to be eligible following a change in circumstances and were granted a new 12-month eligibility period during the April - July 2024 reporting periods, along with data on individuals due for renewal in these months. South Dakota did not initiate or complete renewals in the March - July 2024 reporting period due to a mitigation strategy for ex parte functionality. South Dakota did not initiate renewals in the February 2024 reporting period due to a mitigation strategy for ex parte functionality. Due to temporary renewal process changes, most renewals due in Iowa, including ex parte renewals, were not completed by the end of the reporting month for the December 2023 - February 2024 reporting periods. Hawaii and Vermont experienced a natural disaster, and the number of renewals initiated and completed in the reporting period were impacted due to the disaster response efforts in the month of August 2023. South Carolina does not have renewal outcomes to report in the month of July 2023. Massachusetts reports the dispositions of renewals completed in the reporting period. Therefore, the state is unable to report the number of pending renewals to CMS, and Massachusetts\u2019 data are excluded from the national totals for the May - July 2023 reporting periods. Vermont experienced a natural disaster, and the number of renewals initiated and completed in the July 2023 reporting period were impacted due to the disaster response efforts. Texas does not have renewal outcomes to report in the month of June 2023. For the May 2023 reporting period, Texas\u2019 renewal disposition data include actions completed after the end of the reporting period.

As of the September 2023 report, this table was updated to differentiate between SBMs with an integrated Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace eligibility system and those with an account transfer process to better represent the percentage of QHP selections in relation to applicable consumers received and processed by the relevant SBM. State-specific variations are:      \r\n- Maine\u2019s data and Nevada\u2019s April and May 2023 data report all applications with Medicaid\/CHIP denials or terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process. \r\n- Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington also report applications with consumers determined ineligible for Medicaid\/CHIP due to procedural reasons.\r\n- Minnesota and New York report on eligibility and enrollment for their Basic Health Programs (BHP). Effective April 1, 2024, New York transitioned its BHP to a program operated under a section 1332 waiver, which expands eligibility to individuals with incomes up to 250% of FPL. As of the March 2024 data, New York reports on consumers with expanded eligibility and enrollment under the section 1332 waiver program in the BHP data.\r\n- Idaho\u2019s April data on consumers eligible for a QHP with financial assistance do not depict a direct correlation to consumers with a QHP selection.\r\n- Virginia transitioned from using the HealthCare.gov platform in Plan Year 2023 to an SBM using its own eligibility and enrollment platform in Plan Year 2024. Virginia\u0027s data are reported in the HealthCare.gov and HeathCare.gov Transitions Marketplace Medicaid Unwinding Reports through the end of 2024 and is available in SBM reports as of the April 2024 report. Virginia\u0027s SBM data report all applications with Medicaid\/CHIP denials or terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process, and as a result are not directly comparable to their data in the HealthCare.gov data reports.\r\n- Only SBMs with an automatic plan assignment process have and report automatic QHP selections. These SBMs make automatic plan assignments into a QHP for a subset of individuals and provide a notification of options regarding active selection of an alternative plan and\/or, if applicable, making the first month\u2019s premium payment.  \u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cli\u003ESBMs report on all applicable applications received and not on the Medicaid-defined cohorts of individuals whose renewal is due in a given month.

As such, activities by any one consumer may be included across reporting months. For example, a consumer who submits an application and receives a determination of QHP eligibility may be counted in one month but his\/her plan selection could be counted in a later month. Thus, the percentages do not necessarily depict a direct correlation to the count of consumers on applications received during the current reporting month. Total counts represent activity across the reporting months and are not cumulative as of the latest reporting month. Updated applications in the reporting month are only counted once. Updated applications in a following month may be counted again in that applicable month only if the consumer obtains a new Medicaid\/CHIP renewal.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cli\u003ESBMs have different operational processes and eligibility systems for handling QHP, Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations. While CMS works with SBMs to align the metric definitions across the Marketplaces there can be limitations and anomalies among the SBM data due to different SBM system capabilities. Additionally, variances in the data may be attributable to differences in how states are conducting unwinding renewals including processing timelines and whether states are staging applications for population cohorts (e.g., over age 65).\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ol\u003E\t\r\nPercentages shown are of consumers on applications whose Medicaid\/CHIP coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period month.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nPercentages shown are of consumers on account transfers whose Medicaid\/CHIP coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period month. The percentages for SBMs with integrated eligibility systems and the SBM Total - Integrated and SBM Total data record groups are marked as not available (NA) because SBMs with integrated eligibility systems do not receive account transfers. Additionally,  some SBMs with account transfer processes adjusted, with guidance from CMS, the count of \u0022Consumers on Account Transfers Associated with a Medicaid\/CHIP Coverage Denial or Termination Following Renewal\u0022 to include all consumers on applications who are associated with a Medicaid\/CHIP coverage denial or termination following renewal for purposes of calculating the Percent - Account Transfer data record group. For example, Pennsylvania conducts automatic QHP eligibility determinations for Marketplace plans for some account transfers and as of the December 2023 report, revised its data to report those consumers in the account transfer and application metrics. As of the April 2024 report, New Jersey revised its data to report consumers on account transfers and direct applications in the account transfer and application metrics to reflect overall SBM activity in the Percent - Account Transfer data record group.\r\n\u003Cbr \/\u003EAPTC: Advance Premium Tax Credit; CHIP: Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program; QHP: Qualified Health Plan; BHP: Basic Health Program","accessLevel":"public","accrualPeriodicity":"R\/P10Y","issued":"2023-07-28T19:25:40+00:00","modified":"2024-12-27T18:51:00+00:00","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.medicaid.gov"},"contactPoint":{"fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:Medicaid.gov@cms.hhs.gov"},"theme":["Unwinding"],"keyword":["marketplace","transitions in coverage"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"csv","downloadURL":"https:\/\/download.medicaid.gov\/data\/sbm-marketplace-december-2024-release.csv","describedBy":"https:\/\/data.medicaid.gov\/api\/1\/metastore\/schemas\/data-dictionary\/items\/ae3ebcfc-d5d1-4773-8b42-026aa006ac3c","describedByType":"application\/vnd.tableschema+json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"xlsx","downloadURL":"https:\/\/download.medicaid.gov\/data\/sbm-december-2024-release.xlsx"}],"bureauCode":["009:00"],"programCode":["009:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","title":"HealthCare.gov Marketplace Medicaid Unwinding Report","identifier":"9a83ba5e-05f5-47f5-82de-f3a59233a912","description":"Metrics from individual Marketplaces during the current reporting period.
